Project Overview
Make a simple form by executing the following event handlers and on Change functions.
For Email - make an onChange function to check if the value of input has more than 3 characters or not and if it contains "@" and "."
Similarly Password should be more than 8 characters, make an onChange function for the same.
As soon as the email and password pass the check make sure to remove the red errors and show a green text saying all good to go.
On click of the submit button throw a confirmation window and if the user presses okay, then throw an alert saying successful signup!
Else redirect them to the same page and clear all the input values.
